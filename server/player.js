/*
This file holds all the game logic for the player portal

-Provide game state information to front end for display (or will that be handled by the state.js route?)
-When action is selected
    -check if action is allowed
    -check action type (e.g., move, pick up, enable, make visible)
    -update game state
    -Front end must now refresh
